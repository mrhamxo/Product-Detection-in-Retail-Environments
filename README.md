# AI-Based Product Detection System for Retail Environments

## Abstract
In the dynamic and competitive retail environment, efficient inventory management is critical for enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Traditional manual methods for tracking products on retail shelves are labor-intensive and prone to errors, leading to stockouts, misaligned restocking efforts, and increased shrinkage. This project aims to develop an automated product detection system using advanced computer vision techniques to address these challenges. The system will detect and classify products on shelves in real-time, providing retailers with accurate insights into product availability, shelf organization, and restocking needs. 

By integrating this technology, retailers can streamline inventory management, reduce stockouts, improve restocking efficiency, and mitigate losses due to theft or misplaced items. The proposed solution has the potential to significantly enhance inventory practices, improving both operational performance and the customer experience.

## Project Requirements
- **Functional Product Detection Model**: Accurately identifies and classifies products on retail shelves.
- **Improved Inventory Management**: Reduced stockouts and enhanced customer satisfaction.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Enable retailers to optimize restocking strategies.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides actionable insights from real-time detection data.

## Objectives
1. **Automate Product Detection**: Accurately detect and classify products on retail shelves to reduce manual tracking.
2. **Monitor Shelf Inventory in Real-Time**: Provide continuous insights into product availability to prevent stockouts and enhance accuracy.
3. **Improve Restocking Efficiency**: Facilitate data-driven restocking by identifying low-stock items.
4. **Reduce Shrinkage**: Minimize product loss through consistent monitoring and detection of inventory discrepancies.
5. **Enhance Customer Satisfaction**: Ensure product availability, leading to a better shopping experience.

## Problem Strategy

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Image Dataset**: Comprehensive dataset of retail shelf layouts and products under diverse conditions.
- **Labeling**: Annotate dataset images with bounding boxes and product category labels.
- **Preprocessing**: Normalize images, resize for YOLOv11 input, and apply augmentations (rotation, scaling, flipping).

### 2. Model Selection and Training
- **YOLOv11 Architecture**: Utilized for its speed and ability to handle object detection in a single forward pass.
- **Loss Function**: Combines Localization Loss, Confidence Loss, and Class Probability Loss.
- **Training**: The model learns to detect and classify products on shelves from the dataset.

### 3. Real-Time Detection
- **Single-Pass Detection**: YOLOv11 predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities efficiently.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Processes video feeds or images from cameras monitoring store shelves.

### 4. Deployment and Integration
- **Edge/Cloud Processing**: System deployable on edge devices or cloud infrastructure.
- **Integration**: Connects with inventory management systems to trigger alerts and assist in decision-making.

### 5. Post-Detection Processing
- **Stock Alerts**: Automated notifications for low-stock or out-of-stock situations.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies shrinkage or misplaced items by comparing detections with inventory data.
- **Restocking Optimization**: Generates reports to enhance restocking efforts.

### 6. Evaluation and Continuous Improvement
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate using precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP).
- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tune YOLOv11 for challenging cases like small or overlapping objects.
- **Feedback Loop**: Retrain model with new data to adapt to store-specific layouts and variations.

## Summary
This project develops an automated product detection system using YOLOv11 to improve inventory management in retail environments. By detecting and classifying products in real-time, the system minimizes stockouts, enhances restocking efficiency, and reduces shrinkage. 
Integrating this solution with inventory systems enables actionable insights and better decision-making for retailers. The project leverages YOLOv11's efficiency to streamline retail operations, improve customer satisfaction, and automate labor-intensive inventory processes.
